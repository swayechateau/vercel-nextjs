# Portfolio Repo

Former portfolio repository, now archived due to moving away from Next.js. I aimed to create a site that doesn't rely on JavaScript, making it accessible to users with JavaScript disabled. In my view, many websites use excessive JavaScript unnecessarily.

New Portfolio Repo: https://github.com/swayechateau/portfolio
